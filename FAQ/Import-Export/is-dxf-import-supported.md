### Is autocad .dxf import supported in draw.io?

The [core draw.io project](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) does not support .dxf import, nor, at the time of writing (2019), is there any intention of adding support.

There is no known workaround of exporting to a different format in AutoCAD and importing that alternate format into draw.io.
