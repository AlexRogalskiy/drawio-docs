## Authentication and security

Once you have logged into OneDrive or Google Drive, and allowed the Diagram Viewer app to access your cloud storage, the login credentials stored in your browser are used to embed the files. Client-side authentications ensures that permissions are always correct - you can only embed the files that you (the user) can see.

**Note:** Administrators do not need to grant the app any special permissions for users to be able to embed files.

## Supported file formats

You can embed files stored in Google Drive and One Drive in the following formats:

- draw.io diagrams
- VSD and VSDX file types
- Google and Microsoft Office files: documents, spreadsheets, presentations
- Images and PDF files
- Audio and video files
- Photos and photo albums
- Google Forms (supports form submission)
- Folders

## Diagram Viewer app for Confluence Cloud
